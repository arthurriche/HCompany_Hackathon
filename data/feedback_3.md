## Overview
The audit focused on the Quote Gallery web app at http://localhost:8080, with the primary goal of identifying bugs by navigating through all main sections and testing key interactions.

## Work Done
- Visited the main navigation tabs: Categories, Daily Quote, Search, and Favorites (as visible in the navigation bar).
- Explored multiple quote categories: Inspiration, Love, Humor, Philosophy, Life, Success, and Minimalism.
- Interacted with category filters and viewed quotes in each selected category.
- Observed the presence of interaction icons (copy, favorite) on each quote card.

## Detailed Findings
- Navigation between categories (e.g., Humor, Philosophy, Life) works smoothly, as shown in the screenshots.
- Quotes are displayed correctly for each category, and the UI updates to reflect the selected category.
- The quote cards consistently display author names and interaction icons.
- The navigation bar is persistent and allows access to other main sections (though screenshots only show the Categories section).

## Bugs/Broken Links etc.
- No bugs, errors, or broken links were observed in the navigation or category switching process.
- All visible UI elements (category buttons, quote cards) function as expected based on the screenshots.
- There is no evidence in the screenshots of interactions with "Daily Quote," "Search," or "Favorites" tabs, so their functionality cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.

## Suggestions
- Include screenshots or evidence of interactions with the "Daily Quote," "Search," and "Favorites" sections to ensure comprehensive coverage of all main navigation tabs.
- Test the copy and favorite icons on quote cards to confirm they work as intended.
- Consider adding error handling or empty state messages for categories with no quotes (not observed, but a best practice).
- Ensure accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support) are tested in future audits.
